## Connect 4 Game
This Connect 4 game was built by my team as part of Google's Computer Science Summer Program for Highschool students using JavaScript.

## How to Play
Connect 4 is a two-player game where each player takes turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective of the game is to connect four of your own discs of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent does.

To start the game, click on the "New Game" button. Player 1 starts by clicking on the column where they want to drop their disc. The disc will fall to the lowest available position in that column. Then, it's Player 2's turn. Players continue taking turns until one player connects four discs of their own color, or the entire grid is filled with discs.
